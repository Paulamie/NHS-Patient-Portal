# NHS Insight  
*A patient data management and analysis platform built with Flask.*

---

## Introduction

**NHS Insight** is a Python-based web application built using Flask. It serves as the backend for a data dashboard system to support healthcare staff in managing, viewing, and analyzing patient-related data. The application reads CSV files and uses Python logic to interpret and visualize the information via a simple web interface.


## Data Files

The application expects structured data input in `.csv` format, including:
- `InputTest.csv`
- `Feeding Dashboard data.csv`
- `Algorithm.csv`

These are processed and displayed through the dashboard.


##  Development Notes

- `testingref.py` was used for testing CSV logic.
- Diagrams can be found in the `docs/` directory.
- You can modify `algorithm.py` to extend processing logic or plug in additional analytics.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication and session handling
- Export processed data to PDF or Excel
- Integrate database storage for historical data
- Improve visual charts using libraries like Chart.js or Plotly
